Deployment Strategy for Real-Time PII Defense

1. Where It Fits
Think of the PII Detector as a security control layer, just like a firewall or IDS/IPS, but instead of blocking malicious packets, it monitors and scrubs sensitive data (PII) before it leaks.

 Firewall: Blocks unauthorized network traffic.
 IDS/IPS: Detects and prevents intrusions.
 Guardian 2.0: Detects and prevents PII leaks in real-time.

2. Deployment Options

 a) At the Network Perimeter (like a Next-Gen Firewall)
 Deploy Guardian 2.0 as a plugin/extension at the Web Application Firewall (WAF).
 All incoming/outgoing traffic flows through it.
 If it detects PII (e.g., phone numbers, Aadhaar, addresses), it redacts before logs/storage.

 b) As an IDS/IPS Sensor (Internal Monitoring)
 Deploy Guardian 2.0 in an IDS.
 Works like an IDS sensor — scans logs, Kafka streams, or API responses.
 If it finds PII in unexpected places, it alerts Security Team + masks it in real time.

3. Recommended Strategy
Use a layered defense (Defense-in-Depth) — the same way firewalls + IDS + IPS are layered:

1. Perimeter Defense (WAF/Firewall Integration):
    Stop PII leaks at the ingress layer.
    Example: Mask Aadhaar/UPI IDs before they enter logs.

2. Internal Defense (IDS Mode):
    Deploy Guardian as monitoring sensors across services.
    Detect accidental PII storage in databases or logs.

4.Benefits in Security Terms

 Low Latency: Works inline like IPS.
 Scalable: Like firewall clusters, Guardian scales horizontally.
 Cost-Effective: No need to rewrite every app — deploy at gateways.
 Compliance: Ensures logs/databases don’t store raw PII (GDPR, PCI-DSS, etc.).
